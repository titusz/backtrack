# BACKTRACK - Audio Recorder

You are on a band rehearsal jamming along with your friends. Suddenly a great
tune just manifests out of thin air:

*"Dude, we have to record that..."*

By the time you have set up the recording gear the tune has vanished to
where it came from.

**Not any more... ;.)**
